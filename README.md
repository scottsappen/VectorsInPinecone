# Vectors In Pinecone
This was just an excuse for me to use the Pinecone console.

My initial impression can be summed up as WOW. Serverless takes away my operational woes and the ease at which the console allows you to ingest and query/sample data is impressive.

I had never messed with a vector database, but Pinecone's website/docs and console made it easy to understand and get to work. Zero to hero fast in my mind. Ha!

# Serverless
So yeah, let me repeat that, serverless is sweet. It's very developer-friendly. In under a few minutes, I went from having nothing to having a live queryable index of sample data.

# Sample Data
Instead of creating my own index, which I'll get to, I decided to use the sample data button. It looks like a pretty cool data set and gave me a chance to use the text to vector OpenAI embedding model too.

I did some digging to learn about the embeddings model [text-embedding-ada-002](https://openai.com/blog/new-and-improved-embedding-model). I'll get back to that later with the OpenAI API.

# Index
I absolutely love the browser interface for the indexed data.
